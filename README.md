# Welcome to `operato`!

September 2022 is a month to remember (well at least if you get excited about advanced numerical simulation). 
The reason is that [Altair](https://www.altair.com) announced the immediate availability in the opensource domain 
of their explicit finite element code Radioss (re-branded to [OpenRadioss](https://www.openradioss.org)). Now it is
up to the community to start adding usefull new features and hopefully `operato` is one of them.

# So what is `operato`?
`operato` is a set of tools and utilities that support the use of OpenRadioss. I currently have several tools in mind:
 - A Python package to facilitate the programmatic generation of meshes
 - A conversion tool for the conversion of OpenRadioss `.h3d` files to any of the VTK file formats
